checklist_auto_scan.py
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Automated pre-check scanner for the parts of the WPT master checklist
(~421 items, categories like SQL Injection / XSS / Business Logic / Auth
Testing / Race Conditions / etc.) that CAN safely be verified by a
read-only script: HTTP response headers, TLS handshake/certificate info,
DNS TXT records (SPF/DMARC/DKIM), and a small set of known-safe GET/OPTIONS
probes (robots.txt, common backup/dotfiles, crossdomain.xml, admin paths).

This is NOT a replacement for sqlmap / Burp / nuclei / manual testing -
those items still need the tool named in the checklist's "Tools" column,
or a human. Every checklist item this script does NOT test is listed in
the output as result=MANUAL with a note, so nothing looks silently
skipped or silently "passed".

DEFAULT BEHAVIOUR - READ THIS FIRST
  By default every URL you give is tested TWICE, automatically, with no
  flag needed:
    1. the EXACT URL you gave, including its sub-folder/path - e.g.
       https://127.0.0.1:4434/subfolder is tested as-is, and any
       path-based probe (robots.txt, backup files, .git exposure, admin
       paths, crossdomain.xml, dependency manifests, ...) is run UNDER
       that same sub-folder (https://127.0.0.1:4434/subfolder/robots.txt).
    2. the SITE ROOT of that same host - https://127.0.0.1:4434/ - since
       a lot of what the checklist is looking for (server config, TLS,
       admin interfaces, DNS/email records, backup files that were never
       meant to be reachable) usually lives at the root regardless of
       which page/app path you were given.
  Every result row says which of the two (url_role: "given-url" or
  "site-root") it came from, so nothing is ambiguous in the report. Pass
  --skip-root-pass if you only want the exact URL tested and not the
  automatic extra root pass.

  Every row where a check can't be verified automatically and needs a
  human/dedicated tool is marked result=MANUAL, and its comment always
  starts with the fixed phrase "Manual test required." (plus specifics
  after it) - so you can filter/search for exactly that phrase in the
  report to build your manual work queue.

USAGE
  # single URL - tests both the URL itself and its site root by default
  python3 checklist_auto_scan.py --url https://127.0.0.1:4434/subfolder

  # a list of URLs, one per line (# comments / blank lines ignored) -
  # EVERY url in the file gets the same full treatment (both passes)
  python3 checklist_auto_scan.py --url-file urls.txt --out results

  # self-signed / internal lab target, longer timeout
  python3 checklist_auto_scan.py --url https://10.0.0.5 --insecure --timeout 15

  # only test the exact URL given, skip the automatic site-root pass
  python3 checklist_auto_scan.py --url https://example.com/portal/ --skip-root-pass

  # also run the light common-admin-port scan (off by default, noisier)
  python3 checklist_auto_scan.py --url https://target.example.com --port-scan

  # skip auto-screenshots entirely (they're on by default for FAIL rows)
  python3 checklist_auto_scan.py --url https://target.example.com --screenshot none

  # also generate one for PASS rows (proof of a clean check), or for everything
  python3 checklist_auto_scan.py --url https://target.example.com --screenshot fail+pass
  python3 checklist_auto_scan.py --url https://target.example.com --screenshot all

AUTO-GENERATED "EVIDENCE SCREENSHOTS" - no manual screenshotting needed
  Taking a screenshot by hand for every one of ~77 automated checks x
  however many URLs you're testing doesn't scale. So by default, every
  FAIL row gets its own auto-generated evidence card - a rendered PNG
  showing the URL, checklist ID/test name, category/severity, the exact
  evidence text, and timestamp - the same information you'd otherwise be
  screenshotting from a terminal by hand. It's a rendered summary card,
  NOT a live browser screenshot of the target page - it's meant to stand
  in as the "Artefacts" evidence a report needs for an automated check,
  not to replace an actual browser screenshot of an exploited XSS/SQLi/etc.
  Needs Pillow (pip3 install Pillow); scanning still completes normally
  without it, just without screenshots (a warning is printed once).
  Control which rows get one with --screenshot {none,fail,fail+pass,all}
  (default: fail).

  Where the screenshots end up:
    - Embedded as base64 PNG in <out>.json (field: evidence_image_base64)
      on every row that got one - NOT written to .csv (keeps it readable;
      .csv instead gets a Screenshot: yes/no column).
    - Also embedded as real, viewable images directly in <out>.xlsx on a
      dedicated "Evidence" sheet (needs Pillow only - xlsxwriter embeds
      whatever image bytes it's given either way).
    - JUMP HOST / RESTRICTED-COPY WORKFLOW: if you're running this on a
      jump host where only clipboard text comes back to your real machine
      (no file transfer), copy the printed JSON (or just paste the
      relevant row's evidence_image_base64 value) back to your own
      machine and run the companion script to turn it back into real
      .png files:
        python3 extract_evidence_images.py results.json --out screenshots/
      See extract_evidence_images.py's own --help for details; it ships
      alongside this script.

OUTPUT
  Every run writes THREE files from the same results (no flag needed):
  <out>.csv, <out>.json, and <out>.xlsx - a color-coded, filterable
  workbook (PASS/FAIL/MANUAL/INFO/ERROR highlighted, autofilter + frozen
  header row) plus a Summary sheet, so it's easy to navigate as a
  tracking list. <out> defaults to checklist_scan_<timestamp>. The .xlsx
  needs "pandas" and "xlsxwriter" (pip3 install pandas xlsxwriter); if
  either is missing the script still writes .csv/.json and just skips
  .xlsx with a note.

REAL COMMAND-LINE TOOL INTEGRATION (curl / nmap / sslyze / sslscan / testssl.sh)
  Auto-detected via PATH, no flag/config needed - if a tool is installed,
  it's used automatically to capture REAL command output as evidence:
    - curl runs once per HTTP Security Headers check (WA-HDR-392..398,401)
      and its exact "$ curl ..." command + raw response headers is
      appended to the evidence text.
    - The first of nmap (--script ssl-enum-ciphers), sslyze, sslscan, or
      testssl.sh found on PATH runs once per HTTPS target and its output
      both becomes the evidence for WA-TLS-402/404 AND drives a real
      PASS/FAIL determination (weak-cipher/weak-protocol pattern
      matching) instead of leaving those two MANUAL.
  Rows carrying this kind of real command output get a TERMINAL-STYLE
  evidence screenshot (black background, monospace) instead of the usual
  summary card, so the screenshot itself looks like an actual terminal
  capture of the command that ran. Pass --no-cli-tools to disable all of
  this and use the pure-Python/MANUAL fallback only (e.g. for speed, or if
  you don't want subprocesses shelled out at all).

AUTHENTICATED SCANNING AND ACCESS CONTROL TESTING (opt-in, --cookie / --cookie2)
  This script NEVER logs in, brute-forces, guesses, or harvests
  credentials anywhere - it has no login flow at all. What it CAN do, if
  you hand it a session Cookie header value you already obtained yourself
  by logging in (e.g. copied from your browser's dev tools, or a Burp
  Proxy history entry), is use that pre-authenticated session to run
  EVERY check in the suite as that logged-in user, and automatically
  extend coverage as follows - this is "auto check": pass one cookie and
  it covers everything a single session can test; add a second and it
  covers the two-account checks too, with no extra flags needed:
    - --cookie alone: every one of the ~100 checks runs authenticated,
      PLUS WA-OTG-312 (auth bypass / force-browse) gets real testing -
      compares the SAME url with no session at all vs. with --cookie's
      session; byte-identical responses mean the page doesn't actually
      require login.
    - --cookie + --cookie2 (a SECOND, DIFFERENT account's own session):
      ALSO gets WA-SS-071 (horizontal privilege escalation) and
      WA-OTG-314 (IDOR) real testing - compares what account 1 (--cookie)
      and account 2 (--cookie2) each see at the same URL. Byte-identical
      responses are reported as MANUAL (not an automatic FAIL) since only
      a human can confirm the URL/resource is actually meant to be
      account-specific rather than shared/public.
    - A coverage report prints before scanning starts (what will be
      attempted) and again in the final summary (what was actually
      recorded), so you always know exactly which checklist IDs got real
      testing vs. stayed MANUAL for the run you just did.
  --account1-cookie/--account2-cookie/--account1-label/--account2-label
  still work exactly as before (and --cookie/--cookie2 auto-populate them
  unless you set those explicitly) - --cookie/--cookie2 are just the
  simpler names to reach for, since they also authenticate everything
  else in the suite. The cookie VALUES themselves are never written to
  evidence/JSON/CSV/screenshots - only status codes, byte lengths, and
  the pass/fail comparison outcome are.

REQUIREMENTS
  Python 3.7+, standard library only for the CSV/JSON scan itself. Uses
  the system "openssl" and "nslookup" command-line tools if present (both
  ship with macOS/Linux; nslookup also ships with Windows, but on Windows
  use the PowerShell script instead - Checklist_AutoScan.ps1 - which uses
  native .NET/PowerShell cmdlets and needs no external tools at all) to
  enrich the TLS and Email Security checks, and "curl"/"nmap"/"sslyze"/
  "sslscan"/"testssl.sh" if present to enrich Header and TLS checks with
  real command output (see above). Their absence degrades those specific
  checks to INFO/MANUAL - it does not break the rest of the scan.

# --creds / --creds-file - a friendlier way to hand this script account 1/2
# for check_access_control_2fa() than typing --cookie/--cookie2 by hand.
#
# Since this script never logs in (see below), a password is NOT needed and
# is NOT read from these entries at all - typing one is wasted effort.
# Three forms are accepted per line/entry, in order of what's checked:
#
#   1. "label::cookie"            <- RECOMMENDED - no password, just a
#                                     readable name and the session cookie
#                                     you already obtained by logging in
#                                     yourself as that user.
#   2. "label:password::cookie"   <- legacy form, kept for compatibility.
#                                     Whatever is typed as "password" is
#                                     parsed out and thrown away unread -
#                                     it is never stored/logged/used.
#   3. "cookie_name=value"        <- bare cookie, no label at all (no "::",
#                                     but contains "=" so it's recognised
#                                     as a raw Cookie value, e.g. a line
#                                     that's just "JSESSIONID=abc123").
#
# A line with neither "::" nor "=" (just "label" or "label:password" and
# nothing else) has no cookie to test with and is reported as skipped.
#
# Multiple cookie values for ONE account (e.g. a session cookie plus a
# separate CSRF/XSRF cookie) go on the SAME line as one Cookie-header
# string, semicolon-separated - e.g.:
#   alice::JSESSIONID=abc123; XSRF-TOKEN=def456
# (If the second value must be sent as its own HTTP header rather than a
# cookie - e.g. a custom "X-CSRF-Token: ..." header - use --header instead/
# in addition; --cookie only ever fills in the Cookie header.)
#
# IMPORTANT - this does NOT add a login flow. This script still never logs
# in, brute-forces, or harvests credentials anywhere (see the module
# docstring). The label is used ONLY as a readable name in evidence text
# (e.g. "Alice" instead of "Account 1"). The only thing that actually
# authenticates any request is the cookie - if an entry has no cookie at
# all, there is nothing this script can test with for that account (no
# username/password alone ever produces a working session here), and it's
# reported as skipped rather than silently ignored.
