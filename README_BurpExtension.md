# WPT Checklist Scanner — Burp Suite extension (v1)

A Burp Suite tab that runs the WPT checklist's ~100 automatable, non-destructive
checks against your **current authenticated Burp session**, shows results grouped
by category right inside Burp, cross-references Burp's own Scanner findings, and
exports in the exact JSON/CSV/XLSX schema your ReportSystem "Import Auto-Scan
Results" page already accepts.

This is **v1** — it covers the same ~100/421 checklist items `checklist_auto_scan.py`
already covers (headers, TLS, cookies, CORS, clickjacking, email security, path
probes, basic IDOR), but now driven by your live Burp session instead of a
manually-typed cookie on the command line. It does **not** yet cover SQLi, XSS,
SSRF, and the other active-injection categories — see "Roadmap: external tool
integration" below for how those get added in later phases.

---

## 1. How it's built (read this first)

Burp only loads Python extensions through **Jython**, which is stuck on Python
2.7 syntax and has none of the third-party packages (`requests`, `pandas`,
`xlsxwriter`, `Pillow`, ...) that `checklist_auto_scan.py`'s ~100 checks and its
`.xlsx` writer depend on. Rewriting all of that in Jython would mean
reimplementing and re-testing logic that already works and that
`Checklist-AutoScan.ps1` and the Django portal both also rely on.

So this extension is a **thin Jython shell** that:

1. builds a tab and results table inside Burp (Swing UI),
2. pulls your target list and session Cookie/Authorization header from Burp's
   own Proxy history and scope — so every test runs as **you**, authenticated,
3. shells out to a **real Python 3** interpreter (the one you said is already
   installed on your remote machine) running `checklist_auto_scan.py` with that
   captured session, and
4. reads back the JSON it writes and renders it as the results table you see in
   Burp.

Nothing about `checklist_auto_scan.py`'s actual test logic changes — the
extension just drives it with real session data instead of you typing
`--cookie` by hand.

## 2. Files in this bundle

| File | Goes where |
|---|---|
| `WPTChecklistScanner.py` | The Burp extension itself. Load it directly in Burp — see Installation below. |
| `checklist_auto_scan.py` | The real scanner. Must sit on the SAME machine Burp is running on (the extension shells out to it locally, not over the network). Keep it next to `WPTChecklistScanner.py`, or point the extension at wherever it already lives (e.g. inside your `ReportSystem` folder) — the path is configurable in the extension's UI. |

---

## 3. Installation

### 3.1 Prerequisites

- **Burp Suite Professional or Community**, any recent version. (Professional
  is recommended overall for this project — see the coverage-expansion notes
  from earlier — but v1 itself works in Community too, since it only reads
  Proxy history/scope, which both editions have.)
- **Python 3** installed and on PATH (or know its full path) on the SAME
  machine Burp runs on — you already have this on your remote machine.
- **Jython standalone JAR** — this is what lets Burp load `.py` extensions at
  all. Download `jython-standalone-2.7.3.jar` (or newer) from
  https://www.jython.org/download — pick the **standalone** jar, not the
  installer.

### 3.2 Point Burp at Jython

1. In Burp: **Extensions → Extension settings** (older Burp versions: the
   **Options** sub-tab under **Extender**) → **Python Environment**.
2. Set **Location of Jython standalone JAR file** to the `.jar` you downloaded.
3. No restart needed — Burp picks it up immediately.

### 3.3 Load the extension

1. **Extensions → Installed → Add**.
2. **Extension type: Python**.
3. **Extension file**: browse to `WPTChecklistScanner.py`.
4. Click **Next**. The **Output** tab in that same screen should show:
   `WPT Checklist Scanner loaded. Open the 'WPT Checklist Scanner' tab to configure and run.`
   If you instead see a Python traceback, see Troubleshooting below.
5. A new **WPT Checklist Scanner** tab appears in Burp's main tab bar.

---

## 4. Configuration (top panel of the extension tab)

| Field | What to set it to |
|---|---|
| **Python 3 interpreter** | `python3` if it's on PATH, otherwise the full path (e.g. `C:\Python311\python.exe` on Windows, `/usr/bin/python3` on Linux/macOS). |
| **checklist_auto_scan.py path** | Full path to the script. Defaults to the same folder the extension was loaded from — use **Browse...** if you keep it elsewhere (e.g. your `ReportSystem/` folder). |
| **Output folder** | Where scan output (`.json`/`.csv`/`.xlsx`) gets written before you export it. Defaults to your system temp folder. |
| **Targets** | One URL per line. Type them directly, or click **Pull in-scope targets from Proxy history** to auto-populate from what you've already browsed through Burp (requires Target → Scope to be set first). |
| **Cookie header** | Your authenticated session's Cookie value. Click **Capture session (Cookie) from Proxy history** to grab it automatically from the most recent in-scope request, or paste your own. |
| **Extra header** | Optional — e.g. `Authorization: Bearer eyJ...` for token-based auth instead of/in addition to cookies. |

**Nothing is sent anywhere except to your own target** — the captured
Cookie/Authorization values are only used locally, passed straight through to
`checklist_auto_scan.py` as `--cookie`/`--header` on your own machine.

---

## 5. Using it

- **Run All Tests** — runs the full ~100-check suite against every target
  listed, using the captured/entered session. Populates both the **Summary**
  tab (category-by-category pass/fail counts) and **Detailed Results** tab
  (every row, color-coded PASS=green/FAIL=red/MANUAL=yellow/INFO=blue/
  ERROR=gray — same scheme as the `.xlsx` output).
- **Re-run Selected** — select one or more rows in **Detailed Results** first,
  then click this. Only those Checklist IDs are re-tested (against the same
  targets/session) and merged back into the existing results — everything else
  stays as it was. Useful after you've fixed something and want to confirm the
  retest without re-running the whole suite.
- **Export → ReportSystem JSON/CSV/XLSX** — copies the last scan's output files
  to a folder you choose. The JSON is in the exact schema your ReportSystem
  portal's **Import Auto-Scan Results** page already accepts — upload it there
  directly, no conversion needed.
- **Pull Burp Scanner findings for these targets** (third sub-tab) — reads
  Burp's own Scanner issues (requires Burp Pro's Scanner to have already run,
  actively or passively, against the target) and lists them for
  cross-reference. **These are informational only and are never included in
  the export** — they don't map to real WPT checklist IDs, so merging them in
  would corrupt your checklist data. Use this tab to sanity-check "did Burp's
  own scanner already flag something in this area" while you review results,
  not as an import source.

## 6. What v1 covers vs. what it doesn't

Covered (same ~100 items as `checklist_auto_scan.py`/`Checklist-AutoScan.ps1`,
now running authenticated via your live session): HTTP Security Headers,
SSL/TLS, Clickjacking, CORS, Information Gathering, Configuration Testing,
Session Management, Client-Side Testing (storage heuristic), Email Security,
Information Disclosure, HTTP Host Header Attacks, basic Access Control/IDOR
(force-browse always; the two-account horizontal-escalation checks still need
a second account's cookie, same as the command-line tool).

**Not covered yet** — SQL Injection, XSS, HTTP Request Smuggling, CSRF (beyond
basic token-presence checks), SSRF, XXE, Command Injection, Path Traversal,
Race Conditions, Web Cache Poisoning, Business Logic, JWT Attacks, and
everything else that needs active payload injection rather than a read-only
probe. See the roadmap below.

---

## 7. Roadmap: external tool integration (not built yet)

This is the plan for closing the gap from ~100 to the ~220–260 items discussed
earlier, phased so each piece can be added and tested independently:

**Phase 2 — wrap existing free Burp extensions (no new dev work, just result
cross-referencing, similar to how the "Burp Scanner Findings" tab works today):**
- **Turbo Intruder** (BApp Store) → Race Conditions
- **HTTP Request Smuggler** (BApp Store) → HTTP Request Smuggling
- **Param Miner** (BApp Store) → Web Cache Poisoning / Web Cache Deception

**Phase 3 — external tool orchestration (the extension exports a captured
request + your session cookie, invokes the tool as a subprocess, parses its
output back into checklist rows):**
- **sqlmap** → SQL Injection, NoSQL Injection
- **Dalfox** → reflected/stored XSS
- **jwt_tool** → JWT Attacks (alg=none, weak secret, etc.)
- **Burp Collaborator** (built into Burp Pro) → out-of-band confirmation for
  blind SQLi, SSRF, blind command injection, XXE — no separate tool needed,
  just Collaborator client integration in the extension.

**Phase 4 — DOM confirmation:**
- **Playwright** (headless Chromium) → confirms DOM-based XSS actually
  executes in a real browser context, not just that a payload reflects
  unencoded — this is what separates "found a pattern" from "confirmed
  exploitable."

Each phase adds its own config fields (tool path, e.g.) and its own section in
this document once built — nothing above is implemented in this v1 file.

---

## 8. Troubleshooting

**Extension fails to load / traceback in the Output tab on load** — almost
always a Jython path problem. Re-check Extensions → Extension settings →
Python Environment points at a real, readable `jython-standalone-*.jar`
(not the installer jar).

**"checklist_auto_scan.py not found at: ..."** — the path field is wrong; use
**Browse...** next to it rather than typing the path by hand.

**Scan fails with a non-zero exit code and stderr text about a missing
module** — your `python3` needs `pandas`/`xlsxwriter` for the `.xlsx` output
(`pip3 install pandas xlsxwriter`, add `--break-system-packages` if your OS
complains about an externally-managed environment) and `Pillow` if you want
evidence screenshots (`pip3 install Pillow`). CSV/JSON output still works
without either.

**Export folder is missing the `.xlsx` (only `.csv`/`.json` show up)** — this
is the *same* missing-`pandas`/`xlsxwriter` situation above, but it does
**NOT** fail the scan or show a non-zero exit code — `checklist_auto_scan.py`
degrades gracefully and just skips writing the `.xlsx`, printing a warning to
stdout that used to only be visible in Extensions' **Output** console. The
extension's status bar (bottom of the tab) now says explicitly when this
happened after a scan, and the **Export** button's status message repeats it.
Fix: `pip3 install pandas xlsxwriter` on the SAME `python3` the "Python 3
interpreter" field above points at, then re-run.

**"No in-scope requests found in Proxy history yet"** when clicking Pull
targets / Capture session — set **Target → Scope** first, then browse the
target through Burp's Proxy (or just replay one request through Repeater) so
there's at least one in-scope entry in Proxy history to read from.

**"Pull in-scope targets from Proxy history" grabs way more targets/domains
than expected, and the checklist runs against all of them (a large,
unexpected total row/check count)** — this button trusts Burp's own
`isInScope()` check, which is driven entirely by **Target → Scope**. If you
haven't explicitly added your target there (or "Use advanced scope control"
is off), Burp treats *everything* it's seen in Proxy history as in-scope -
every CDN, analytics/tracker domain, third-party asset host, etc. that your
browser touched while proxied through Burp - and this button will happily
pull up to 50 of those distinct hosts, each then getting the full checklist
run against it. Fix: **Target → Scope** tab → tick **Use advanced scope
control** → **Add** → enter just your actual authorized target(s) (e.g.
`pentest-ground.com`) → re-click **Pull in-scope targets from Proxy
history**. You can also just hand-edit the **Targets** text box directly
before clicking **Run All Tests** - it's a plain text field, delete
whatever doesn't belong.

**Evidence column is truncated / can't see the actual request or response
for a row** — the Detailed Results grid caps each Evidence cell at 300
characters so the table stays readable. **Double-click any row** to open a
dialog with the full, untruncated evidence text - including the real `$
curl ...` command and response, if the **"Use command-line tools..."**
checkbox above the Targets box is ticked (it's on by default; earlier
builds of this extension always ran with that internally disabled, which
is why runs from inside Burp never showed real request/response evidence
the way the standalone CLI tool does).

**Subprocess hangs or never returns** — Jython's `subprocess` module has had
occasional platform-specific quirks in some Jython builds. If a scan seems
stuck, check the extension's **Output** tab for the exact command line being
run, and try running that exact command by hand in a terminal to isolate
whether the issue is in `checklist_auto_scan.py` itself (network/target
issue) or in Jython's process handling (report back with what you see either
way — this is the one part of v1 that's hardest to fully test outside a real
Burp installation, so feedback here is genuinely useful for a v1.1 fix).

**Results table doesn't color rows** — cosmetic only, doesn't affect the
data. Confirm you're on a Burp version with standard Swing table rendering
(this has been true for all recent Burp releases); if it persists, the Result
column values are still fully readable as text either way.

---

## 9. Full feature list (v1)

- Custom "WPT Checklist Scanner" tab inside Burp with three sub-tabs: Summary,
  Detailed Results, Burp Scanner Findings (context only).
- Pull in-scope targets directly from Burp's Proxy history.
- Capture the live session's Cookie/Authorization header from Proxy history,
  or enter your own.
- Run the full ~100-check suite against one or many targets, authenticated.
- Re-run just selected rows (by Checklist ID) without re-running everything.
- Category-by-category summary counts (Total/Pass/Fail/Manual-or-other).
- Full results table, color-coded by Result, matching the `.xlsx` scheme.
- Cross-reference Burp's own Scanner issues for the same targets (display
  only, never exported/merged into checklist data).
- One-click export of JSON/CSV/XLSX in the exact schema your ReportSystem
  "Import Auto-Scan Results" page already accepts — no new portal-side code
  needed.
- Runs scans on a background thread so the Burp UI never freezes.

## 10. Features planned but NOT in this v1 (see Roadmap, section 7)

- SQLi/XSS/SSRF/XXE/Command Injection/Path Traversal active testing
- HTTP Request Smuggling / Web Cache Poisoning (via wrapping existing BApp
  Store extensions)
- Race condition testing (via Turbo Intruder)
- JWT deep-testing (via jwt_tool)
- DOM-XSS confirmation (via headless browser)
- Direct push to ReportSystem's import endpoint (skipping the manual
  export-then-upload step)
- A persistent config (currently every field resets when the extension
  reloads — planned as a small settings-save feature once the above phases
  are further along)
